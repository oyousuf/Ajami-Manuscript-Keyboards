# Ajami-Manuscript-Keyboards

This repository contains keyboards to type/transcribe Ajami manuscripts. The letters/diacritics available on each language's keyboard reflects what is needed to accurately transcribe their manuscripts. Historically, the orthographies of many languages were unstandardized, therefore each keyboard may include multiple variants of the "same letter" (i.e., ف/ڢ). There were several governmental and organizational (i.e., ISESCO (now ICESCO)) efforts to standardize the orthographies of different languages in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. However, the keyboards here reflect the original orthographies as they appear in older manuscripts.
